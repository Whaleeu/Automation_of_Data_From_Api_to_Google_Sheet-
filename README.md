# Automation_of_Data_From_Api_to_Google_Sheet

Project Overview: Automated Data Extraction, Transformation, and Analysis Pipeline

Objective:
Automate the extraction of data from Skubana API, perform necessary transformations and analysis, and subsequently load the processed data into Google Cloud Storage (GCS) on an hourly basis.

Key Components:

Data Extraction from Skubana API:

Set up a robust and secure connection to the Skubana API for extracting relevant data.
Implement a scheduled process to retrieve data from Skubana at hourly intervals.
Data Transformation:

Design a comprehensive transformation pipeline to clean, format, and structure the extracted data.
Apply any necessary business logic or calculations to derive meaningful insights.
Data Analysis:

Integrate analytical tools or scripts to gain insights from the transformed data.
Perform hourly analyses to uncover trends, anomalies, or key performance indicators.
Automation Using Cron:

Implement a cron job scheduling system to orchestrate the entire data pipeline.
Ensure reliability and error handling mechanisms are in place for seamless automation.
Loading into Google Cloud Storage (GCS):

Develop a mechanism to efficiently load the processed data into GCS.
Consider optimizing storage formats and structures for easy retrieval and further processing.
Benefits:

Real-time Insights: Hourly updates provide timely insights into business operations.
Data Accuracy: Automation reduces the likelihood of human errors in data handling.
Scalability: The pipeline is designed to scale with growing data volumes and evolving business needs.
Cost-Effectiveness: Leveraging cloud storage and automation minimizes operational costs.
Technologies Used:
Skubana API, Data Transformation Tools (e.g., Pandas, Apache Spark), Cron Job Scheduler, Google Cloud Storage (GCS)

Conclusion:
This project aims to streamline the data extraction, transformation, and analysis processes from Skubana, ensuring that timely and accurate insights are available for informed decision-making. The use of automation, cloud storage, and analytical tools contributes to an efficient and scalable solution.
